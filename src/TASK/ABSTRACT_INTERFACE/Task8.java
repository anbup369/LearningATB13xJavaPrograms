8. Interface Polymorphism

ðŸ”¶ Objective:

Learn how interfaces support polymorphism â€“ calling the same method on different implementations.

ðŸ”¶ Steps:

Create an interface Playable with method play().

Create two classes: Guitar and Piano, both implement Playable.

Implement the play() method in both classes with different messages.

In main(), declare a reference of type Playable and assign it objects of Guitar and Piano one by one.

Call play() on each.

ðŸ”¶ Expected Output:

Playing Guitar

Playing Piano
