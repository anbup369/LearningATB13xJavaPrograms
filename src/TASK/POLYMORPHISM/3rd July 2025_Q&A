1) If there is no main method, what will happen?
If your program doesn’t have a main method, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) won’t know where to begin.

2) Does main method return any value?
No, the main method has a **void** return type, which means it does not return anything.

3) what is main method?
- It’s the entry point for your Java application.
- JVM calls this method when you run your program.
- Its signature must be precise:

public static void main(String[] args)

4) (String[] args) what is this in main method?

- It's a way to accept command-line arguments.
- String[] means an array of strings.
- You can pass inputs like java MyProgram Hello World — and args[0] would be "Hello", args[1] would be "World".

5) main(String[] args) in this instead of args can i write something else like java, or Selenium like this (String[] Selenium)?

This is valid — the array name can be anything (args, java, Selenium, etc.).

6) public static void main(String args[]) { } is this right main method, is this will work? ([] position is changed)

Yes. The positioning of the brackets []—before or after the variable name—is flexible in Java. Both mean the same thing: you're declaring a method that takes an array of String


7) public static void main(String[]args) { }, is this right main method, is this will work? (i have removed the space between []args)

yes, this is valid. Space between [] and args is optional.

8) public static void main(String...args) { }, is this right main method, is this will work? ( i have removed [] and added ...)

-  This works too! String... args is called varargs, introduced in Java 5.
- It allows zero or more arguments and is treated like an array internally.

9) static public void main(String[] args) { is this valid main method ?

 Also valid! The order of static and public doesn’t matter


10) public void static main(String[] args) {} is this valid main method?

-  Invalid. Keywords like public, static, and the return type must be in proper order.
- Correct order: public static void


11) public static main void (String[] args) {} is this valid main method?

Invalid syntax. This is a jumbled version of what the JVM expects

12) Who Gets Highest Priority in Execution?

The main method gets top priority.

If multiple classes have main methods, the JVM executes the one you specify using Class Name.
