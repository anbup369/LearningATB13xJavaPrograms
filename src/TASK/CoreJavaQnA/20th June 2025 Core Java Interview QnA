20th June 2025 Core Java Interview QnA

1) What is Git and GitHub?
- Git: A distributed version control system that helps track code changes and collaborate across teams.
- GitHub: A cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories, providing collaboration tools like pull requests, issues, and code reviews.

2) Difference Between Git and GitHub:
- Git is the version control tool; GitHub is the online service that hosts Git repositories.
- Git works locally on your system; GitHub facilitates sharing and collaboration online.

3) Flow/Structure of Java Programs:
- Package declaration (optional)
- Import statements
- Class declaration
- Main method: public static void main(String[] args)
- Inside main, include statements, variable declarations, method calls, logic.

4) Execute Java Program Without JDK?
- No, JDK (Java Development Kit) is necessary for compiling Java code. You may run precompiled `.class` files using JRE, but cannot develop/compile without JDK.

5) Multiple JDK/JRE Installation:
- Yes, you can install multiple JDKs or JREs.
- Use environment variables like `JAVA_HOME` to switch between versions.

6) What is Main Method?
- It's the entry point of every standalone Java application.
- Syntax: `public static void main(String[] args)`

7) Multiple Main Methods?
- Yes. A class can have multiple methods named `main()` with different parameters, but only the standard one (`public static void main(String[] args)`) acts as the program entry point.

8) Run Program Without Main Method?
- Yes, but only for specific contexts like using JavaFX or static blocks, or in older versions of Java. For standard execution, main is required.

9) Difference: println vs printf vs print:
- println(): Prints and moves to new line.
- print(): Prints without moving to new line.
- printf(): Prints formatted output (like String.format with placeholders).

10) Default Value of Local Variable:
- Local variables **do not have default values**. You must initialize them before use, or Java will throw a compile-time error.

11) Who Provides Default Value to Variable?
- The Java Runtime Environment assigns default values to instance and static variables onlyâ€”not local variables.

12) Can Final Variable Value Be Changed?
- No. A variable declared `final` cannot be reassigned once initialized.
