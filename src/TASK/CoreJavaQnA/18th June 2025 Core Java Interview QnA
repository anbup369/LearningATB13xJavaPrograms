18th June 2025 Core Java Interview QnA

1) What is a Data Type?
- A data type specifies the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or boolean values.

2) Explain All Data Types in Detail:
- Java has two categories:
  a) Primitive Data Types:
     - byte: 8-bit integer
     - short: 16-bit integer
     - int: 32-bit integer
     - long: 64-bit integer
     - float: 32-bit decimal
     - double: 64-bit decimal
     - char: a single 16-bit Unicode character
     - boolean: true or false
  b) Reference/Object Data Types:
     - Used to refer to objects like arrays, strings, and custom classes.

3) Default Value of Boolean in Java:
- The default value of a boolean data type is false.

4) Types of Operators in Java:
- Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
- Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
- Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Unary Operators: +, -, ++, --
- Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
- Ternary Operator: condition ? true : false
- instanceof Operator: checks object type

5) Difference between float and double:
- float: 32-bit, single-precision, ends with ‘f’. Example: 3.14f
- double: 64-bit, double-precision, more accurate. Example: 3.14

6) Eight Primitive Data Types in Java and Their Default Values:
| Data Type | Default Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| byte      | 0              |
| short     | 0              |
| int       | 0              |
| long      | 0L             |
| float     | 0.0f           |
| double    | 0.0d           |
| char      | '\u0000'       |
| boolean   | false          |

7) Convert String to Primitive Data Type:
```java
String num = "50";
int number = Integer.parseInt(num);

- Difference Between Local and Instance Variables:

- Local Variable: Declared inside methods, used only within that method.
- Instance Variable: Declared in a class but outside methods, accessible to all methods within the class.

- What is a JIT Compiler?

- JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler translates Java byte code into native machine code at runtime to improve performance.

- What is a Package in Java?

- A package is a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces into a folder structure. It helps avoid naming conflicts and makes code modular.

- What is a Class in Java?

- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods).

- What is a Method?

- A method is a block of code that performs a specific task, can be called and reused throughout the program.

- Loops in Java and Their Types:

- Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop
- for-each loop (used for arrays/collections)


- What is an Infinite Loop?

- An infinite loop is a loop that never ends because the termination condition is never met. Example:

while(true) {
  System.out.println("This will run forever!");
}
