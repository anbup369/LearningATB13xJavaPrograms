17th June 2025 Extra Task
1) What is Source Code?
- Source Code is the original code written by a programmer using a high-level programming language like Java, Python, C++, etc.
- It's human-readable and represents the instructions that tell the computer what to do.
- Example: System.out.println("Hello, World"); is source code in Java.

2) What is Byte Code?
- Byte Code is an intermediate code generated after compiling source code in languages like Java.
- Itâ€™s not machine-specific, making it portable across systems.
- Java's byte code is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3) What is Native Code?
- Native Code (also known as machine code) is the low-level binary code specific to a computer's processor architecture.
- This is the final form of code that a system can directly execute.
- Unlike byte code, native code is platform-dependent.

4) What is Java Compiler?
- The Java Compiler is a tool that converts Java source code into byte code.
- The most commonly used Java compiler is javac.
- It checks for syntax errors and ensures the program can run on the JVM.

5) What is JIT Compiler?
- JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler is part of the JVM.
- It translates byte code into native code at runtime, improving performance.
- Helps in optimizing frequently executed code paths while the program runs.

6) Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

| Feature          | Compiler                           | Interpreter                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Execution         | Translates entire code at once     | Translates and runs one line at a time |
| Speed             | Faster after compilation           | Slower due to line-by-line execution |
| Error Detection   | Detects all errors at once         | Detects errors as it interprets      |
| Output            | Produces an intermediate file (e.g. .class) | No intermediate file           |
| Languages Used    | C, C++, Java (compiles to bytecode) | Python, Ruby, JavaScript             |
