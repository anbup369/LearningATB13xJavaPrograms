Q1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It's designed to be:
- Platform-independent thanks to the JVM
- Robust and secure
- Ideal for building applications ranging from mobile to enterprise and embedded systems

Q2. Features of Java
Java boasts a rich set of features that make it incredibly popular:
- Platform Independence: Write once, run anywhere
- Object-Oriented: Everything revolves around objects and classes
- Robust: Strong memory management and exception handling
- Secure: Built-in security features like bytecode verification and sandboxing
- High Performance: Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler boosts runtime performance
- Distributed: Supports networking and remote method invocation (RMI)
- Multithreaded: Handles multiple tasks simultaneously using threads

Q4. What is JDK and its Components?
JDK (Java Development Kit) is the full suite used for developing Java applications. It includes:
- JRE: Runtime for running Java apps (includes JVM + libraries)
- JVM: Executes compiled Java code (bytecode)
- Development Tools: javac, java, javadoc, jdb — for compiling, running, and debugging
- Java APIs: Libraries and packages like java.util, java.io, etc.

Q5. Is JVM Platform-Independent?
Yes! The JVM is implemented differently for each platform, but Java bytecode runs on any JVM regardless of the system — making Java platform-independent. Compile once, run anywhere.

Q6. Difference Between JDK and JRE

| Feature             | JDK                          | JRE                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Includes JVM        | Yes                           | Yes                      |
| Includes JRE        | Yes                           | No                       |
| Development Tools   | Yes (javac, debugger, etc.)   | No                       |
| Purpose             | Develop + run Java apps       | Only run Java apps       |
