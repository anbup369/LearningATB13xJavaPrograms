19th June 2025 Core Java Interview QnA



1) What is a Keyword in Java?
- Keywords are reserved words predefined in Java language with specific meanings and purposes. They cannot be used as variable names, class names, or identifiers.
- Examples: class, public, static, if, else, return, void.

2) What are Identifiers in Java?
- Identifiers are the names used for classes, methods, variables, labels, etc. They are defined by the programmer.
- Example: int totalMarks; — "totalMarks" is an identifier.

3) Where Can’t We Use Keywords in a Program?
- Keywords cannot be used to name variables, methods, classes, or any user-defined elements because they are reserved by the language.

4) Rules for Identifiers:
- Must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z), currency character ($), or underscore (_)
- Subsequent characters can include digits (0-9)
- No spaces or special characters like @, #, etc.
- Cannot be a keyword
- Java is case-sensitive, so `Variable` and `variable` are different identifiers.

5) What is a Magic Value in Java?
- Magic value refers to hardcoded values in code that lack explanation, making the code harder to understand.
- Example: `if(score > 65)` — here, `65` is a magic number without context.

6) What is a Statement in Java?
- A statement is a single line of code that performs a specific action, typically ending with a semicolon `;`.
- Example: `int x = 10;`

7) Difference Between print and println:
- `print()`: Outputs text without moving to the next line.
- `println()`: Outputs text and moves the cursor to the next line.

8) By Default println Uses Which Data Type to Show Arithmetic Result?
- By default, `println` uses the most appropriate data type based on the operands. If mixing types, Java applies **type promotion**, often resulting in a `double` or `int`.

9) Difference Between Keyword and Identifier:
| Aspect     | Keyword                          | Identifier                         |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Definition | Reserved word in Java language   | Name assigned to elements by user |
| Usage      | Fixed meaning; can't be changed  | Custom names for variables, etc.  |
| Examples   | int, class, return               | myAge, studentName                 |

10) How Many Keywords Are There in Java?
- Java currently has **approximately 50 reserved keywords**, including `class`, `interface`, `enum`, `throws`, and more.
