1st July Constructor Q&A

1. What is a constructor in Java?
- A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is instantiated.
- It has the same name as the class and no return type (not even void).

2. How is a constructor different from a method?

| Feature | Constructor | Method |
| Purpose | Initializes an object | Performs operations or logic |
| Name    | Same as class name | Can be any valid name |
| Return Type | None (not even void) | Must have a return type |
| Invocation | Called automatically when object is created | Called manually using object reference |

3. What are the different types of constructors in Java?

Types of Constructors in Java
- Default Constructor: No parameters; auto-provided by compiler if not defined.
- Parameterized Constructor: Accepts arguments for custom initialization.
- Copy Constructor (not built-in, but can be manually written): Creates an object by copying another object.

4. What is constructor overloading?

- Multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists.
- Allows creating objects in different ways.

class Demo {
    Demo() {
        System.out.println("Default constructor");
    }

    Demo(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    }
}

5. Can a constructor be final, static, or abstract?

-  final: Not allowed. Constructors arenâ€™t inherited, so final isnâ€™t meaningful.
-  static: Not allowed. Constructors are tied to object instances, not classes.
-  abstract: Not allowed. Constructors must be implemented, not abstract.

6. Can we call a constructor explicitly inside another constructor?

- Yes, using this() for same class or super() for parent class constructors.

class Example {
    Example() {
        this("Hello");
    }

    Example(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg);
    }
}

7. What happens if you donâ€™t define a constructor in a class?

ava automatically provides a default constructor (with no parameters) that does nothingâ€”except call super() in case of inheritance.
