ðŸ”¹Program 4: Implicit Typecasting (Widening)

                    Description: Convert int A =100 to double.

ðŸ”¹ Program 5: Explicit Typecasting (Narrowing)

                  Description: Casts a double to an int, cutting off decimals value.

ðŸ”¹ Program 6: Character to ASCII

                    Description: Typecasts a character to its ASCII integer value. Example Print A ASCII Int value.

ðŸ”¹ Program 7: Typecasting in Division

                     Description: int a = 10, int b = 3; now divide 10/3 and store the decimal value in the Result variable and print it.
