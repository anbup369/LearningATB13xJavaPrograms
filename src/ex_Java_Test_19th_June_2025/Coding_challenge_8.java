**Requirements:**
- A year is leap if it's divisible by 4
- Exception: if divisible by 100, it's not leap unless also divisible by 400
- Use logical operators in conditions

input
2020 1900 2000
output
2020 is a leap year   -->ğŸ’¡ Explanation:2020 is divisible by 4 and not a century year
1900 is not a leap year ğŸ’¡ Explanation:1900 is divisible by 100 but not by 400
2000 is a leap yearğŸ’¡ Explanation:2000 is divisible by 400
